# ðŸ§© Data Drivers

Tools to encode and decode arguments passed to Dusk contracts, bridging  
low-level RKYV bytes and JavaScript inputs/outputs.

This package acts as a collection of utilities and helpers that simplify  
interaction with contracts from both Rust and JavaScript contexts.

## ðŸ“¦ Subpackages

Each folder inside `data-drivers/` is a local package with its own README  
and focus area:

- `data-driver/`: Utilities to encode & decode arguments.  
- `stake-contract/`: Library to encode/decode contract inputs/outputs for the stake contract.  
- `transfer-contract/`: Library to encode/decode contract inputs/outputs for the transfer contract.

For details on each, see their local README files.
