# Data Driver for the Stake Contract

This module provides data-driver implementation for the Stake Contract.
As described in the README for the data-driver module, this module
implements only the `ConvertibleContract` interface, delegating the all
other tasks to the generic data-driver, which is included into this module
as dependency.

Please refer to data-drivers/data-driver/README.md for more information.
