## Build system and dev environment

The build system assumes that you have at least Node.js v20.x installed. The LTS version is 20.11.1 at the time of writing.

All terminal commands assume that you are positioned in root folder of the repository.
Run `npm install` from the root folder to get the necessary dependencies.

## Environment variables

The application defines these variables by reading a local `.env`

```
# *_PATH variables can be empty string, must start with a slash otherwise, must not end with a slash

VITE_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.dusk.network/v1"
VITE_BASE_PATH="" # Optional, set to '/explorer' when deploying to an 'apps.*' subdomain
VITE_BLOCKS_LIST_ENTRIES=100
VITE_CHAIN_INFO_ENTRIES=15
VITE_MARKET_DATA_REFETCH_INTERVAL=120000
VITE_NODE_URL="" # Optional, set to (e.g. 'https://nodes.dusk.network' to) override default
VITE_PROVISIONERS_REFETCH_INTERVAL=30000
VITE_REFETCH_INTERVAL=10000
VITE_RUSK_PATH="" # Optional, set to '/rusk' for dev mode
VITE_STATS_REFETCH_INTERVAL=1000
VITE_TRANSACTIONS_LIST_ENTRIES=100
```

## Environment variables and dev mode

The application defaults to setting the node URL to `/`. In dev mode, requests made on `/rusk` are passed through a proxy to `localhost:8080`. When the app is running in dev mode, set `VITE_RUSK_PATH` to "/rusk".

The application will determine which network it is connected to by the subdomain it is hosted under, to override this and connect to any node set `VITE_NODE_URL`. Note that only `https://` protocol URLs are valid.
