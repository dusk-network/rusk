## Good to know

Some commands can be run in standalone (offline) operation:
- `create`: Create a new wallet
- `restore`: Access (and restore) a lost wallet
- `address`: Retrieve public spend key
- `export`: Export BLS provisioner key pair

All other commands involve transactions, and thus require an active connection to [**Rusk**](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk).

## Installation

[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```
git clone https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk.git
cd rusk/rusk-wallet/
make install
```

## Configuring the CLI Wallet

You will need to connect to a running [**Rusk**](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk) instance for full wallet capabilities.

The default settings are located in [config.toml](config.toml).

The base data directory will be provided via the `--data-dir` argument. It defaults to `$HOME/.dusk/config.toml`.

The configuration file `config.toml` will be read from the base data directory. If none is present, the default settings will be copied to the base data directory, and used.

The CLI arguments takes precedence and overrides any configuration present in the configuration file.

## Running the CLI Wallet

### Interactive mode

By default, the CLI runs in interactive mode when no arguments are provided.

```
rusk-wallet
```

### Headless mode

Wallet can be run in headless mode by providing all the options required for a given subcommand. It is usually convenient to have a config file with the wallet settings, and then call the wallet with the desired subcommand and its options.

To explore available options and commands, use the `help` command:
```
rusk-wallet help
```

To further explore any specific command you can use `--help` on the command itself. For example, the following command will print all the information about the `stake` subcommand:
```
rusk-wallet stake --help
```

By default, you will always be prompted to enter the wallet password. To prevent this behavior, you can provide the password using the `RUSK_WALLET_PWD` environment variable. This is useful in CI or any other headless environment.

Please note that `RUSK_WALLET_PWD` is effectively used for:
- Wallet decryption (in all commands that use a wallet)
- Wallet encryption (in `create`)
- BLS key encryption (in `export`)
