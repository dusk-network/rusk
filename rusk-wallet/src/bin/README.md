## Good to know

Some commands can be run in standalone (offline) operation:

- `create`: Create a new wallet
- `restore`: Access (and restore) a lost wallet
- `addresses`: Retrieve your addresses
- `export`: Export BLS provisioner key pair

All other commands involve transactions, and thus require an active connection to [**Rusk**](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk).

## Installation

[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```
git clone git@github.com:dusk-network/rusk.git
cd rusk/rusk-wallet
make install
```

## Configuring the CLI Wallet

You will need to connect to a running [**Rusk**](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk) instance for full wallet capabilities.

The default settings can be seen [here](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/blob/master/rusk-wallet/default.config.toml).

It's possible to override those settings by create a `config.toml` file with the same structure, in one of the following
directory:

- The wallet directory (provided via the `--wallet-dir` argument, defaults to `$HOME/.dusk/rusk-wallet/`)
- The global configuration folder (`$HOME/.config/rusk-wallet/`)

The default wallet directory can also be changed by setting `wallet_dir = ...` in a `config.toml` file located in the same
directory as the `rusk-wallet` binary.

Having the `config.toml` in the global configuration folder is useful in case of multiple wallets (each one with its own wallet directory) that shares the same settings.

If a `config.toml` exists in both locations, the one found in the specified wallet directory will be used.

The CLI arguments takes precedence and overrides any configuration present in the configuration file.

**Note:** When using Windows, connection will default to TCP/IP even if UDS is explicitly specified.

## Running the CLI Wallet

### Interactive mode

By default, the CLI runs in interactive mode when no arguments are provided.

```
rusk-wallet
```

### Headless mode

Wallet can be run in headless mode by providing all the options required for a given subcommand. It is usually convenient to have a config file with the wallet settings, and then call the wallet with the desired subcommand and its options.

To explore available options and commands, use the `help` command:

```
rusk-wallet help
```

To further explore any specific command you can use `--help` on the command itself. For example, the following command will print all the information about the `stake` subcommand:

```
rusk-wallet stake --help
```

By default, you will always be prompted to enter the wallet password. To prevent this behavior, you can provide the password using the `RUSK_WALLET_PWD` environment variable. This is useful in CI or any other headless environment.

Please note that `RUSK_WALLET_PWD` is effectively used for:

- Wallet decryption (in all commands that use a wallet)
- Wallet encryption (in `create`)
- BLS key encryption (in `export`)
